# word-solver

This project contains a four pieces of code based around fetching words from a dictionary text file.

There is an Anagram Solver, which reads in a set of letters and returns all dictionary words that can be constructed from those letters.

There is a Boggle Solver, which solves all possible words to be made from the game Boggle. Users input an n x n grid of letters, and the 
program returns all possible dictionary words that can be constructed from the grid.

There is a Word Bites Solver, which solves all possible words from the GamePiegon game 'Word Bites'.

Lastly, there is a convenient tool that returns all words that contains, starts with, or ends with a string of user-inputted letters.
